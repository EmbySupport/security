## Emby Server Security Policy

### Supported Versions

[Emby Server Releases](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Releases/releases) are continuous. 

All updates and security patches are always and only rolled out as a new release version.
Patches for earlier major releases are generally not provided. Exceptions are sometimes made in case when there's a transition phase to a new major release.

Beta releases are following the same patterns, yet without any exceptions.
